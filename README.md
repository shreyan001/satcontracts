**Turn every satoshi into a smart contract** – AI-verified escrows for anything digital, powered by Citrea.

SatContracts allows users to create trust-minimized, automated escrow contracts using native Bitcoin (on testnet via Citrea rollup). Users can escrow sats against verifiable actions—like domain leasing, game key rentals, micro-loans, or API metering—using off-chain verification by AI agents.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Native BTC escrows on Citrea rollup
- 🤖 AI agents (LangGraph) verify off-chain outcomes via API & browser automation
- 🧠 JSON-based contract templates (e.g. SaaS usage, game-key loans, bounty splits)
- 🪙 Micro-escrows starting from 10,000 sats
- 📸 Verifiable data proofing (screenshots, signed CID uploads)
- 📊 Live dashboard with escrow vault statuses
- 🧩 Extendable verifier nodes (one per use case)

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/satcontracts.git
   cd satcontracts
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=''
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=''
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY=""
   TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY=''
   ```
   > 🧠 You can obtain your WalletConnect `PROJECT_ID` by visiting [https://cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com)

4. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## 🧪 How It Works

SatContracts converts natural-language agreements into verifiable smart contracts, in six steps:

1. **Chat → JSON Terms**
   LangGraph parses conversation into JSON escrow specs.

2. **Deploy Vault on Citrea**
   `EscrowFactory.sol` emits on-chain contract, hashing the JSON terms.

3. **Event Listener → Verifier Node**
   A verifier (e.g. headless browser/API module) fetches off-chain data for resolution.

4. **Oracle Data Pinned & Signed**
   Data (numeric or screenshot) is uploaded to IPFS and signed by the verifier.

5. **AI Agent Executes Contract**
   Based on rules, funds are released, partially refunded, or default to timeout logic.

6. **Dashboard & Logs**
   React front-end shows vault states streamed via Envio/SubQuery.

## 🔮 Vision: Escrows for the Real World

Bitcoin holders today mostly **store wealth**—but SatContracts lets them **use sats**:

* Use unused BTC as **collateral** in micro-loans
* Lock sats as **temporary deposits** for service usage
* Create **dynamic pay-per-use agreements** for digital subscriptions
* Participate in **global P2P rentals and trades** without relying on trust

With **LangGraph**, every verifier is just another node. Each new use case = a 200-line AI agent + 1 transaction. Simple. Modular. Scalable.
